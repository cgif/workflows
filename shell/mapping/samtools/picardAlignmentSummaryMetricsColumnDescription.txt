TOTAL_READS: The total number of reads including all PF and non-PF reads. When CATEGORY equals PAIR this value will be 2x the number of clusters.<BR>
PF_READS: The number of PF reads where PF is defined as passing Illumina's filter.<BR>
PCT_PF_READS: The percentage of reads that are PF (PF_READS / TOTAL_READS)<BR>
PF_NOISE_READS: The number of PF reads that are marked as noise reads. A noise read is one which is composed entirely of A bases and/or N bases. These reads are marked as they are usually artifactual and are of no use in downstream analysis.<BR>
PF_READS_ALIGNED: The number of PF reads that were aligned to the reference sequence. This includes reads that aligned with low quality (i.e. their alignments are ambiguous).<BR>
PCT_PF_READS_ALIGNED: The percentage of PF reads that aligned to the reference sequence. PF_READS_ALIGNED / PF_READS<BR>
PF_ALIGNED_BASES: The total number of aligned bases, in all mapped PF reads, that are aligned to the reference sequence.<BR>
PF_HQ_ALIGNED_READS: The number of PF reads that were aligned to the reference sequence with a mapping quality of Q20 or higher signifying that the aligner estimates a 1/100 (or smaller) chance that the alignment is wrong.<BR>
PF_HQ_ALIGNED_BASES: The number of bases aligned to the reference sequence in reads that were mapped at high quality. Will usually approximate ##PF_HQ_ALIGNED_READS * READ_LENGTH but may differ when either mixed read lengths are present or many reads are aligned with gaps.<BR>
PF_HQ_ALIGNED_Q20_BASES: The subset of PF_HQ_ALIGNED_BASES where the base call quality was Q20 or higher.<BR>
PF_HQ_MEDIAN_MISMATCHES: The median number of mismatches versus the reference sequence in reads that were aligned to the reference at high quality (i.e. PF_HQ_ALIGNED READS).<BR>
PF_MISMATCH_RATE: The rate of bases mismatching the reference for all bases aligned to the reference sequence.<BR>
PF_HQ_ERROR_RATE: The percentage of bases that mismatch the reference in PF HQ aligned reads.<BR>
PF_INDEL_RATE: The number of insertion and deletion events per 100 aligned bases. Uses the number of events as the numerator, not the number of inserted or deleted bases.<BR>
MEAN_READ_LENGTH: The mean read length of the set of reads examined. When looking at the data for a single lane with equal length reads this number is just the read length. When looking at data for merged lanes with differing read lengths this is the mean read length of all reads.<BR>
READS_ALIGNED_IN_PAIRS: The number of aligned reads whose mate pair was also aligned to the reference.<BR>
PCT_READS_ALIGNED_IN_PAIRS: The percentage of reads whose mate pair was also aligned to the reference. READS_ALIGNED_IN_PAIRS / PF_READS_ALIGNED<BR>
BAD_CYCLES: The number of instrument cycles in which 80% or more of base calls were no-calls.<BR>
STRAND_BALANCE: The number of PF reads aligned to the positive strand of the genome divided by the number of PF reads aligned to the genome.<BR>
PCT_CHIMERAS: The percentage of reads that map outside of a maximum insert size (usually 100kb) or that have the two ends mapping to different chromosomes.<BR>
PCT_ADAPTER: The percentage of PF reads that are unaligned and match to a known adapter sequence right from the start of the read.<BR>
