PCT_AMPLIFIED_BASES: On+Near Amplicon Bases / PF Bases Aligned. The percent of amplicon bases on or near target.<BR>
PCT_OFF_AMPLICON: The percentage of aligned PF bases that mapped neither on nor near an amplicon.<BR>
ON_AMPLICON_VS_SELECTED: The percentage of on+near amplicon bases that are on as opposed to near.<BR>
MEAN_AMPLICON_COVERAGE: The mean coverage of all amplicons in the experiment.<BR>
MEAN_TARGET_COVERAGE: The mean coverage of targets that recieved at least coverage depth = 2 at one base.<BR>

AT_DROPOUT: A measure of how undercovered <= 50% GC regions are relative to the mean. For each GC bin [0..50] we calculate a = % of target territory, and b = % of aligned reads aligned to these targets. AT DROPOUT is then abs(sum(a-b when a-b < 0)). E.g. if the value is 5% this implies that 5% of total reads that should have mapped to GC<=50% regions mapped elsewhere.<BR>
GC_DROPOUT: A measure of how undercovered >= 50% GC regions are relative to the mean. For each GC bin [50..100] we calculate a = % of target territory, and b = % of aligned reads aligned to these targets. GC DROPOUT is then abs(sum(a-b when a-b < 0)). E.g. if the value is 5% this implies that 5% of total reads that should have mapped to GC>=50% regions mapped elsewhere.<BR>
