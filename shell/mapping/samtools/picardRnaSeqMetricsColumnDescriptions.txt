PF_BASES: The total number of PF bases including non-aligned reads.<BR>
PF_ALIGNED_BASES: The total number of aligned PF bases. Non-primary alignments are not counted. Bases in aligned reads that do not correspond to reference (e.g. soft clips, insertions) are not counted.<BR>
RIBOSOMAL_BASES: Number of bases in primary aligments that align to ribosomal sequence.<BR>
CODING_BASES: Number of bases in primary aligments that align to a non-UTR coding base for some gene, and not ribosomal sequence.<BR>
UTR_BASES: Number of bases in primary aligments that align to a UTR base for some gene, and not a coding base.<BR>
INTRONIC_BASES: Number of bases in primary aligments that align to an intronic base for some gene, and not a coding or UTR base.<BR>
INTERGENIC_BASES: Number of bases in primary aligments that do not align to any gene.<BR>
IGNORED_READS: Number of primary alignments that map to a sequence specified on command-line as IGNORED_SEQUENCE. These are not counted in PF_ALIGNED_BASES, CORRECT_STRAND_READS, INCORRECT_STRAND_READS, or any of the base-counting metrics. These reads are counted in PF_BASES.<BR>
CORRECT_STRAND_READS: Number of aligned reads that map to the correct strand. 0 if library is not strand-specific.<BR>
INCORRECT_STRAND_READS: Number of aligned reads that map to the incorrect strand. 0 if library is not strand-specific.<BR>
PCT_RIBOSOMAL_BASES: RIBOSOMAL_BASES / PF_ALIGNED_BASES<BR>
PCT_CODING_BASES: CODING_BASES / PF_ALIGNED_BASES<BR>
PCT_UTR_BASES: UTR_BASES / PF_ALIGNED_BASES<BR>
PCT_INTRONIC_BASES: INTRONIC_BASES / PF_ALIGNED_BASES<BR>
PCT_INTERGENIC_BASES: INTERGENIC_BASES / PF_ALIGNED_BASES<BR>
PCT_MRNA_BASES: PCT_UTR_BASES + PCT_CODING_BASES<BR>
PCT_USABLE_BASES: The percentage of bases mapping to mRNA divided by the total number of PF bases.<BR>
PCT_CORRECT_STRAND_READS: CORRECT_STRAND_READS/(CORRECT_STRAND_READS + INCORRECT_STRAND_READS). 0 if library is not strand-specific.<BR>
MEDIAN_CV_COVERAGE: The median CV of coverage of the 1000 most highly expressed transcripts. Ideal value = 0.<BR>
MEDIAN_5PRIME_BIAS: The median 5 prime bias of the 1000 most highly expressed transcripts, where 5 prime bias is calculated per transcript as: mean coverage of the 5' most 100 bases divided by the mean coverage of the whole transcript.<BR>
MEDIAN_3PRIME_BIAS: The median 3 prime bias of the 1000 most highly expressed transcripts, where 3 prime bias is calculated per transcript as: mean coverage of the 3' most 100 bases divided by the mean coverage of the whole transcript.<BR>
MEDIAN_5PRIME_TO_3PRIME_BIAS: The ratio of coverage at the 5' end of to the 3' end based on the 1000 most highly expressed transcripts.<BR>
